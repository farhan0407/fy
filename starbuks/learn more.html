    <p>History of Coffee: Where did coffee originate and how was it discovered?
        The history of coffee is a fascinating story. The bean has traveled the world for centuries, being smuggled out
        of tough countries, kidnapped from royalty, and changing entire countries and economies. It is remarkable how a
        small bean from a small tree in Ethiopia can become the second largest traded commodity in the world.</p>
